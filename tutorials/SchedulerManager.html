This is a brief tutorial on how to configure the [SchedulerManager]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager} class and use it submit jobs, wait for their completion and get the results back. The following is everything you need to use in order to have access to all the important information (as specified in [jobStatusInformation]{@link module:scheduler/monitors~jobStatusInformation}) of a job whose execution has ended.<br>
A complete example is featured at the end of this tutorial.


<p>
<h3>Configuring SchedulerManager</h3>

Configuration is done via a JSON file, ./input_files/input.json by default. The parameters that can be specified are the following:<br><br>

 <ul>
  	<li>
      <b>[maxRequestsPerSecUser]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxRequestsPerSecUser_}</b>: maximum number of requests a user can issue in a single time unit ([requestLifespan]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#requestLifespan_}). Requests received by a user who has issued the maximum number of requests will not be forwarded to the SGE (unless the user submitting the request is whitelisted).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>[maxRequestsPerSecGlobal]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxRequestsPerSecGlobal_}</b>: maximum number of requests that can be issued by all users collectively in a single time unit ([requestLifespan]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#requestLifespan_}). This is a stronger constraint than [maxRequestsPerSecUser]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxRequestsPerSecUser_}. For example, if three users issued one request each in a given time unit, and [maxRequestsPerSecGlobal]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxRequestsPerSecGlobal_} was set to 3, another request by any user would be rejected (unless the user submitting the request is whitelisted).
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[userLifespan]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#userLifespan_}</b>: time (in seconds) that must pass without any requests being issued by a given user, after which said user will be removed from the user history. The next time the user will submit a request, it will be as if it was the first time the user ever tried to issue one.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[requestLifespan]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#requestLifespan_}</b>: time (in seconds) that a request issued by a user spends in the user's request history, after which it is deleted. This parameter represents the "time unit" mentioned in [maxRequestsPerSecUser]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxRequestsPerSecUser_} and [maxRequestsPerSecGlobal]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxRequestsPerSecGlobal_}.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[maxConcurrentJobs]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxConcurrentJobs_}</b>: maximum number of jobs that can be handled by the SGE at the same time. Requests received by a user when the maximum number of concurrent jobs has already been reached will not be forwarded to the SGE (unless the user submitting the request is whitelisted).
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[maxJobRunningTime]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxJobRunningTime_}</b>: maximum time (in seconds) a [SINGLE]{@link JOBTYPE} job submitted to the SGE can spend in the RUNNING state, after which it is terminated and removed from the job history.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[maxJobQueuedTime]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxJobQueuedTime_}</b>: maximum time (in seconds) a [SINGLE]{@link JOBTYPE} job submitted to the SGE can spend in the ON_HOLD/QUEUED state (without ever switching to RUNNING), after which it is terminated and removed from the job history.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[maxArrayRunningJobTime]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxArrayJobRunningTime_}</b>: maximum time (in seconds) an [ARRAY]{@link JOBTYPE} job submitted to the SGE can spend in the RUNNING state, after which it is terminated and removed from the job history. Note that an [ARRAY]{@link JOBTYPE} job is considered to be RUNNING once the first task starts running.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[maxJobQueuedTime]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#maxArrayJobQueuedTime_}</b>: maximum time (in seconds) an [ARRAY]{@link JOBTYPE} job submitted to the SGE can spend in the ON_HOLD/QUEUED state (without ever switching to RUNNING), after which it is terminated and removed from the job history. Note that an [ARRAY]{@link JOBTYPE} job is considered to be ON_HOLD/QUEUED as long as its first task is ON_HOLD/QUEUED itself.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[localListPath]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#localListPath_}</b>: path to the JSON file listing the blacklisted and whitelisted users for the service this specific instance of [SchedulerManager]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager} module is being used for. The blacklist and whitelist fields are arrays of strings. Regular expressions are supported. See ./input_files/local-lists.json for an example.
    </li>
    <li>
			<b>[globalListPath]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#globalListPath_}</b>: path to the JSON file listing the blacklisted and whitelisted users for all services. Regular expressions are supported. See ./input_files/global-lists.json for an example.<br> If a user is present in the blacklist or whitelist defined in this file, then the user is blacklisted or whitelisted from any and all services, regardless of their presence in the lists specific to any given service.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[minimumInputUpdateInterval]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#minimumInputUpdateInterval_}</b>: minimum time interval (in seconds) between two consecutive reads of the input file. The input file is read whenever a user submits a request, provided the previous read happened at least minimumInputUpdateInterval seconds ago.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[jobPollingInterval]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#jobPollingInterval_}</b>: time (in seconds) dictating how often the status and several other information of a job submitted to the SGE must be checked.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[userPollingInterval]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#userPollingInterval_}</b>: time (in seconds) dictating how often the user history must be checked, in order to detect and purge requests which have exceeded their requestLifespan or users whose userLifespan has expired.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>[listPollingInterval]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#listPollingInterval_}</b>: time (in seconds) dictating how often to read the blacklist and whitelist files specified by [localListPath]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#localListPath_} and [globalListPath]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#globalListPath_}, in order to update the blacklist and whitelist.
    </li>
 </ul>
 <br>
NOTE: a whitelisted user's requests will ALWAYS be forwarded to the SGE. Likewise, a blacklisted user's requests will ALWAYS be discarded.

<p>
<h3>Submitting a job</h3>
 
An instance of the [SchedulerManager]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager} class is created and exported, under the name of Sec, when the server is launched.<br>
To submit a job, [handleRequest]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#handleRequest} must be called. This method requires a {@link requestData} object, which specifies who issued the request, at what time, and the details of the job to submit in the form of a {@link JobTemplate} object.<br>

An example of {@link requestData} would be:<br><br>

<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><table><tr><td><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9</pre></td><td><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">	<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">let</span> requestData <span style="color: #333333">=</span> {
		ip<span style="color: #333333">:</span> requestIp,
		time<span style="color: #333333">:</span> req.time(),
		jobData <span style="color: #333333">=</span> {
			remoteCommand<span style="color: #333333">:</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;\&quot;/path/of/your/job/file.sh\&quot;&quot;</span>,
			workingDirectory<span style="color: #333333">:</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;/your/working/directory&quot;</span>,
			jobName<span style="color: #333333">:</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;name of your job&#39;</span>,
		}
	};
</pre></td></tr></table></div>




<br><br>
For all possible ways to specify the properties of the jobData object, refer to the {@link JobTemplate} documentation.<br><br>

It is now possible to call the [handleRequest]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#handleRequest} method, which returns a promise. For example:<br><br>

<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">let</span> handleRequestPromise <span style="color: #333333">=</span> Sec.handleRequest(requestData);
</pre></div>
<br><br>
As explained in the [handleRequest]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#handleRequest} documentation, the promise resolves only if a job is succesfully submitted to the SGE; the promise is otherwise rejected. To check if the submission was successful, one can do the following:
<br><br>

<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><table><tr><td><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">1
2
3
4
5
6
7</pre></td><td><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">	handleRequestPromise.then( (status) <span style="color: #333333">=&gt;</span> {
		<span style="color: #888888">// Success - job submitted.</span>
		<span style="color: #888888">// Do something else here (see next paragraph).</span>
	}, (error) <span style="color: #333333">=&gt;</span> {
		<span style="color: #888888">// Failure - job not submitted. Print the error to see what went wrong.</span>
		Logger.info(error);
	});
</pre></td></tr></table></div>


<br><br>
In the previous example, the status object which the promise resolves into in case of success is a {@link requestOutcome} object holding several useful information, the most important of which is the job ID (stored in the jobId field) assigned by the SGE to the job that has just been submitted.

</p>
<p>
<h3> Examining the status and other relevant information of a completed job </h3>

To monitor a submitted job, it is sufficient to call the [getJobResult]{@link scheduler/SchedulerManager#getJobResult} method, which requires the id of the job to monitor and returns a promise. As explained in the documentation, said promise resolves when the job that is being monitored enters the COMPLETED or ERROR state, while it is rejected when an error occurs.<br>
In case of success, the promise resolves into a [jobStatusInformation]{@link module:scheduler/monitors~jobStatusInformation} object, containing several information about the now finished job.<br>
For example, to monitor the status of a job whose id is stored in a jobId variable, one would do:<br><br>

<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><table><tr><td><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">1
2
3
4
5</pre></td><td><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">	Sec.getJobResult(jobId).then( (status) <span style="color: #333333">=&gt;</span> {
		Logger.info(<span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;Job &#39;</span> <span style="color: #333333">+</span> status.jobName <span style="color: #333333">+</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&#39; status: &#39;</span> <span style="color: #333333">+</span> status.mainStatus <span style="color: #333333">+</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;, description: &#39;</span> <span style="color: #333333">+</span> status.description);
	}, (error) <span style="color: #333333">=&gt;</span> {
		Logger.info(error.description);
	}
</pre></td></tr></table></div>

<br><br>
Where the status object is of the aforementioned [jobStatusInformation]{@link module:scheduler/monitors~jobStatusInformation} kind, while the error object consists of two fields: the error field, describing the error as returned by the SGE, and the description field, which explains that the status of the job could not be read.
